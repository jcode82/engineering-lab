# Bottleneck Dashboard

Real performance work starts with visualizing the pain. This dashboard runs 10
synthetic samples against three scenarios:

- **Baseline** — healthy queries (~250ms p95)
- **Slow** — intentionally bottlenecked route (~1.4s p95)
- **Optimized** — tuned path after indexing/caching (~70ms p95)
