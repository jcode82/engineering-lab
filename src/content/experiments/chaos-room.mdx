# Chaos Room

The Chaos Room is a predictable way to showcase unpredictable systems.
Every button press hits a chaos API that randomly returns:

- **70%** success (`200 OK`)
- **20%** server explosions (`500`)
- **10%** slow timeouts (3s → `408`)

The client retries up to three times with an abort controller watching for
runaway latency. When all retries fail, the UI degrades politely instead of
screaming in red text.
