# Latency Showdown: The 10ms Coffee Challenge

Humans are strange creatures. We will wait patiently at a DMV for three hours,  
but if a website takes **more than 300ms** to load an image, we start muttering proclamations  
of doom like “this site is broken” or “my internet sucks.”

So today’s experiment asks a silly but revealing question:

> **How much faster does an interaction need to be  
before a regular person *feels* the difference?**

To test this, I built a tiny mock API called the **Coffee Machine**, with 3 latency modes:

- **Baseline:** ~180ms  
- **Slightly optimized:** ~140ms  
- **Over-optimized:** ~10ms  

## The Setup

The fake API randomly returns “☕ Latte ready!” but delays depending on scenario.

<CodeBlock
  language="ts"
  code={`export async function getCoffee(mode: "baseline" | "mid" | "fast") {
  const delay = mode === "baseline" ? 180 :
                mode === "mid" ? 140 : 10;

  await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, delay));

  return { message: "☕ Latte ready!", delay };
}`}
 />

The API isn’t real, obviously.  
The point is to simulate a **real perception threshold experiment**.

## Results

Using the mock latency chart in the hero section of the site, I ran 100 simulated requests:

<ExperimentChart scenario="baseline" />
<ExperimentChart scenario="cached" />
<ExperimentChart scenario="pooled" />

The funny part:  

- Almost nobody noticed the drop from **180ms → 140ms**  
- Everyone noticed **140ms → 10ms**  
- But many couldn’t articulate *why* they felt it was better — they just “liked it more”

This supports a classic UX principle:

> **Small latency wins don’t matter. Big wins do.  
> And humans notice speed emotionally, not logically.**

## Reflection

This experiment isn’t about coffee.  
It’s about understanding where optimization time actually pays off.

Shaving off 10–20ms from a UI interaction is cool, but it won’t make your product magical.  
Shaving off **all but 10ms** will.

Sometimes the most important optimization  
is simply the one a human can *feel*.
