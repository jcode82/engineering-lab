# A Tiny Bug That Taught Me a Big Lesson

There are big bugs — and then the ones so small  
they make you question your career choices.

Yesterday I spent nearly **45 minutes** debugging why a simple JSON parser  
kept exploding inside a tiny helper function.

I tried everything: logging, breakpoints, rewriting the function,  
and even questioning the stability of the universe.

The culprit?

A single stray comma.

One misplaced `,`.

That was it.

In the moment, it was frustrating.  
But afterward, I remembered something important:

> **Software isn’t hard because technology is complicated.  
> Software is hard because humans are involved.**

That stray comma reminded me to slow down, breathe,  
and treat my future self with more kindness (and fewer sleepless commits).

Tomorrow: fresh eyes.  
Tonight: victory tacos.
