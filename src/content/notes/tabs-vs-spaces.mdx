# Tabs vs Spaces: A Thanksgiving Warning

Every year I remind myself of one cardinal rule:

**Never bring up AI, crypto, or code formatting at Thanksgiving.**

This time I slipped.

I casually mentioned that Python developers prefer spaces because “indentation is semantic,”  
and within minutes my cousin—who once took a single online coding bootcamp—was  
performing a dramatic reenactment of how tabs are “more ergonomic.”

Meanwhile, my uncle, who doesn’t own a computer,  
declared that “real programmers use Notepad.”

The lesson?

> Family time is sacred.  
> Keep code wars at work.

Tomorrow I return to my editor.  
Tonight I pass the mashed potatoes and let the tabs vs spaces debate cool off for another year.
