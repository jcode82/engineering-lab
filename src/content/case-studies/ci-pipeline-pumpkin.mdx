# The Day the CI Pipeline Turned Into a Pumpkin

This is a story about how a simple dependency bump  
caused my CI pipeline to collapse at 2 AM like a fairy-tale carriage at midnight.

## Incident

A minor patch upgrade triggered:

- 247 failing build jobs  
- rising container times  
- runners backing up  
- and a Slack channel full of “is anyone awake?”

## Diagnosis

It wasn’t obvious at first.

Builds were intermittently failing with checksum mismatches—  
yet the packages were correct locally.

After digging:

- The dependency graph changed  
- A transitive package switched mirrors  
- The CI cache contained stale tarballs  
- The new mirror required updated checksums

Classic “it only breaks in CI” energy.

## Fix

- Purged the CI cache  
- Rebuilt the lockfile  
- Added deterministic registry URLs  
- Enforced checksum pinning

## Lesson

CI isn’t just a build system.  
It’s a distributed state machine.  
If you don’t treat it like one, you’ll eventually get pumpkins.
