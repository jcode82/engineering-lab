      <h1>The Science of Latency</h1>
      <p>
        Latency is the hidden heartbeat of every networked system.
        Measuring it, visualizing it, and learning from it defines the rhythm of performance engineering.
      </p>
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Latency drives perceived speed</li>
        <li>It reveals bottlenecks in distributed systems</li>
        <li>It helps predict scalability limits</li>
